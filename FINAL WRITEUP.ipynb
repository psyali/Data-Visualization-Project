    "•  We started with component 3 which involved generating the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "•  A map of the United States, where the states are coloured either by the total sightings in each state over the selected time period, or the total time in sightings.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  A plot displaying the total number of sightings in whichever state is highlighted, aggregated so that it is a function of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  A plot displaying the total duration of sightings in whichever state is highlighted, aggregated so that it is a function of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Tooltips should appear when hovering over the state with useful information about the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "•  We loaded the dataset into Jupyter with the given code. \n",
    "\n",
    "•  Next, we added the column for FIPS codes for all the states in United States of America contained in the dataset. We also split the “date” column to have a separate column for “years” in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•  The map of USA was generated using bqplot to display the total duration (in seconds) for the sightings in each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Tooltip was applied to create a tooltip for when we hover the mouse over the name of the state along with the total number of sightings for the location. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Further, a drop-down menu was generated to choose between the number of UFO sightings and the time of sightings. \n",
    "\n",
    "•  Then, we displayed a line chart for the total number of sightings and total duration of sightings for the highlighted state so that it aggregates as a function of the year and tested for the get_state_data function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•  To create the line chart, we first defined a and then, the type of selector. We used a fast interval selector. \n",
    "\n",
    "•  Next, we defined a function that will be called when the FastIntervalSelector interacts with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "•  Then we connected the selectors to that function and finally used the HTML widget to see the value of what we selected and accordingly modified it when an interaction was performed on the selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•  The final part of this component required normalization based on a piece of information about the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  We picked the population for each state for this part. Here, we first read the .csv file in Jupyter Notebook and then used the separate column for FIPS code for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Data cleaning was required here as some states did not have values of population of the first year. Then we created a data frame whose column values are the state-wise population per year from the year 1906 to 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Then we proceeded to component 1 which involved working on the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "•  The approach that I took for component 1 was to read in the location text file in the locations table. It then drops columns a and b which I have considered the last two redundant columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Then we have set station as the index as it will be used for plotting the location of the different stations on the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  By setting the tohoku location and using the haversine formula, I have calculated the distance of each location from the tohoku location.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  This distance values are then sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  The data_tohoku_norm_transpose data is read in the array_vals data frame and a time range of 4 hours is set with each observation differing by 1 sec.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Normalization by replacing the NaN values by the mean is done\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Functions are written then to plot the spectrogram, slider, scatterplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  The interactions between all these functional graphs are done by importing libraries like boken,bqplot, IPython.display and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  At the initial stage, this component required the location.txt file to be read into the Jupyter Notebook for the cleaning of irrelevant data (last two columns). \n",
    "\n",
    "•  Then we set station as the index as it was to be used for plotting the location of the different stations on the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Here, we attempted to plot locations on the map where the earthquakes occurred. These locations are the latitude and longitude values from the location.txt. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•  By setting the tohoku location and using the haversine formula, we have calculated the distance of each location from the tohoku location and sorted the values. \n",
    "\n",
    "•  The data_tohoku_norm_transpose data is read in the array_vals data frame and a time range of 4 hours is set with each observation differing by 1 sec. Normalization by replacing the NaN values by the mean was also carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Finally, we wrote appropriate functions to plot the spectrogram, slider, scatterplot. The interactions between all these functional graphs were done by importing libraries such as boken,bqplot, IPython.display, etc.\n",
